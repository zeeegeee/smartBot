# smartBot

Project utilizing Python to create a deep learning chatbox, the bot uses millions of posts and comments from reddit to build a databse. This bot utilizes TensorFlow's sequence to sequence library to train the bot.
This is not a finished project, I am currently learning about deep learning and how it's implmented.
